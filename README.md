# mailsac-integration-test-examples

This project contains an example Node.js `mocha` integration test suite.

In one test, Mailsac's REST API is used to check whether an email was received with a specific
URL link in the email body. In the other test, Mailsac's realtime Web Socket API is used for
the same purpose.
